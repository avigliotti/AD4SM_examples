# AD4SM_examples

This repository contains examples and other resources that deal with [AD4SM.jl](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM.jl).

## Tutorial
[Here](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/AD4SM_talk.pdf) are the slides of a presentantion on the rationale of automatic differentiation and the advantages of its use for solid mechanics.

[Here](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/tutorial/handson_AD4SM_intro.ipynb) is a tutorial illustrating the implementation of an automatic differentiation system, with particular focus on solid mechanics in Julia, along with an example focussing on the solution of a non-linear truss structure.

## Examples
The example folder contains the following examples:
1. [Non linear truss](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/examples/example_01_non_linear_truss.ipynb)
1. [Euler beam lattice under large displacements](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/examples/example_02_Euler_beams.ipynb)
1. [Plane stress with rigid inclusions](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/examples/example_03_plane_stress.ipynb)
1. [Axi-symmetric problem with internal volume constraint](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/examples/example_04_AxSymDomain.ipynb)
1. [3D non linear spring](https://github.com/avigliotti/AD4SM_examples/blob/master/examples/example_05_3DSpring.ipynb)

## Juliacon2022
